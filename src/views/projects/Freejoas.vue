                  <p>Freejoas is a web application used by those seeking to exercise and find free tasty treats.</p>
                  <p>The goal of this project was to create an easy to use application that could be used by anyone looking for free Feijoas.</p>

              <h1>Background</h1>
              <p>Freejoas is an application used by Kiwis with plans to expand with more free fruit, and to open to overseas users too. <a href="https://freejoas.com/" target="_blank">Checkout Freejoas on your mobile phone today</a></p>
              <p class="exerpt">I am the founder of Freejoas</p>
              <p>I've always been into creating great products that solve a problem. Freejoas came to me when I saw the price of Feijoas in supermarkets. I always wondered why people didn't find their own with the abundance that existed nearby.</p>
              <p>The need for an application to track free Feijoa trees also needed to be:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Easy to use.</strong> Accessible to all walks of life.</li>
                  <li><strong>Feel like a game of hide and seek.</strong> Gamify it for families.</li>
                  <li><strong>Easily manage the status of Freejoas Trees.</strong> We don't want our users to be dissatisfied with the service.</li>

          <p>Freejoas needs to be friendly and familiar. Give the sense of walking in nature. Give the sense of fun and excitement. A free activity for families. A game of hide and seek.</p>

            <h1>Prototyping</h1>
            <p>I worked with a graduate backend developer who needed some real world experience to add to his portfolio.</p>
            <p>I like to create Figma prototypes so that it is easier to see what I am wanting to create. These prototypes are created in a way which show animations as they should be.</p>

            <h1>Testing the current state</h1>
            <p>We prepped the current state of the User Interface by conducting unmoderated tests internally with users who had experience on the current platform.</p>
            <p>Knowing what the most common User Journeys were from our Pulse Energy workshops, I developed a test which we would replicate for the new User Interface that would be designed.</p>
            <div class="img--container"><img :src="uiMobileUITesting" alt="Current landscape"></div>
            <p>Doing this would make comparing our new User Interface with our old one much easier.</p>

          <h1>Creating a working version</h1>
          <p>I want Freejoas to be accessible to all walks of life, so I created a Webapp - something that is accessible on all devices regardless....</p>
          <p>I began by building a simple Front End using <a target="_blank" href="https://react.dev">React</a></p>
          <p>I chose React as it is something I am still learning and wanted to learn while also creating.</p>
          <p>I also chose to use <a target="_blank" href="https://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> - a preprocessor for CSS which makes it easier to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create stylesheets and control the cascading effect of CSS.</li>
            <li>Easier to create hover states and animations.</li>
            <li>Scalable for future development - incase I want to branch out to more types of fruit.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can checkout the working version by visiting <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freejoas.com">www.freejoas.com</a>. I recommend you use your mobile phone to open the app for a cleaner experience. The project is still a work in progress.</p>

            <h1>Project results</h1>
            <p>This is an on-going project. The release relys heavily on the season. I plan on releasing it to the public in January 2025.</p>
            <p>So far, I have had plenty of positive feedback from colleagues, friends, family and perspective employers. I welcome the feedback, be it positive or negative. I have a growth mindset, I want my app to perform at it's best when it is released.</p>
